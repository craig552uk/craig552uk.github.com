<p>Server logs automatically record information and details about your online interactions with us. For example, server logs may record information about your visit to our Site or use our Subscription Service on a particular time and date and collect information such as your device ID or IP address.</p>
<h3 id="cookies">Cookies</h3>
<p>We use cookies on the Site. Cookies are small files that are temporarily stored on your mobile device through the Site. A cookie allows the Site to recognize whether you have visited before and may store user preferences and other information.

<h3 id="pixel-tags">Pixel Tags</h3>
<p>A pixel tag (also known as a web beacon, clear GIF, pixel, or tag) is an image or a small string of code that may be placed in an advertisement or email. It allows companies to set or read cookies or transfer information to their servers when you load a webpage or interact with online content. For example, we or our service providers may use pixel tags to determine whether you have interacted with a specific part of our Services, viewed a particular advertisement, or opened a specific email.</p>
