## Personal Information Provided by Users  

We may also collect information about potential Users (names and email addresses) provided by other Users as part of our referral and invitation sign-up processes.

## Other personal information collected through the Site. 

If you visit our Site, you may navigate the Site without submitting any personal information. However, if you use certain features on the Site we will collect any personal information that you provide through those features.

### Server Logs
Server logs automatically record information and details about your online interactions with us. For example, server logs may record information about your visit to our Site or use our Subscription Service on a particular time and date and collect information such as your device ID or IP address.

### Cookies
We use cookies on the Site. Cookies are small files that are temporarily stored on your mobile device through the Site. A cookie allows the Site to recognize whether you have visited before and may store user preferences and other information. For example, cookies can be used to collect or store information about your use of the Site during your current session and over time (including the pages you view and the files you download), your device’s operating system, your device ID, IP address, and your general geographic location. To learn more about how we use cookies, and advice on managing your preferences, please review our [Cookie Policy](/cookie-policy).

### Pixel Tags
A pixel tag (also known as a web beacon, clear GIF, pixel, or tag) is an image or a small string of code that may be placed in an advertisement or email. It allows companies to set or read cookies or transfer information to their servers when you load a webpage or interact with online content. For example, we or our service providers may use pixel tags to determine whether you have interacted with a specific part of our Services, viewed a particular advertisement, or opened a specific email.

### SDKs and Mobile Advertising IDs. 

Our Site may include third-party software development kits (“SDKs”) that allow us and our service providers to collect information about your activity. In addition, some mobile devices come with a resettable advertising ID (such as Apple’s IDFA and Google’s Advertising ID) that, like cookies and pixel tags, allow us and our service providers to identify your mobile device over time for advertising purposes.

### Third-party Plugins
Our Site may include plugins from other companies, including social media companies (e.g. LinkedIn). These plugins may collect information, such as information about the pages you visit, and share it with the company that created the plugin even if you do not click on the plugin. These third-party plugins are governed by the privacy policies and terms of the companies that created them.

### Third-party Online Tracking
We may partner with certain third parties to collect, analyse, and use some of the personal and other information described in this Notice.
