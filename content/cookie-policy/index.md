This Cookie Policy (“Cookie Policy”) describes how CM Russell Limited (“we,” “our,” “us”) collects, processes, uses, and discloses certain information obtained through your use of our website (the “Site”), which is available at <http://craig-russell.co.uk>. To learn more about our privacy practices in general, please review our [Privacy Notice](/privacy-notice).

## What are cookies?

Cookies are small files that are stored by your web browser through the Site. A cookie allows the Site to recognize whether you have visited before and may store user preferences and other information. For example, cookies can be used to collect or store information about your use of the Site during your current session and over time (including the pages you view and the files you download), your device’s operating system, your device ID, IP address, and your general geographic location.

## What types of cookies do we use?

### Necessary Cookies.  

Necessary cookies allow us to offer the best possible experience when accessing and navigating through our Site. For example, these cookies allow us to recognize that you have created an account with us and accessed the Site previously.

### Functional Cookies.  

Functional cookies let us operate the Site in accordance with the choices you make. For example, we will remember your username and how you have customised the Site for future visits.

### Analytics or Performance Cookies.  

These cookies enable us and third-party services to collect aggregated data on how visitors use the Site for statistical purposes. These cookies do not collect personal information such as your name or email address and are used to help us improve your user experience of the Site.

### Targeting or Advertising Cookies. 

These cookies allow us and third-party services to show more relevant advertising to people who visit the Site (and other websites) by showing you advertisements that are based on your browsing patterns and the way you interact with our Site and others. Please review the section below on interest-based advertising to learn more about third-party advertising cookies in particular.

## How can you manage cookies?

You may stop your browser from accepting cookies altogether by changing your web browser’s cookie settings. You can usually find these settings in the “options” or “preferences” menu of your browser.

## How does the Site use interest-based advertising?

The Site enables third-party tracking mechanisms (including cookies) to collect information about you and your computing devices for use in online interest-based advertising. For example, third parties may use the fact that you visited our Site to target online ads to you about our services. In addition, our third-party advertising networks might use information about your use of our services to help target advertisements based on your mobile activity in general. For information about interest-based advertising practices, including privacy and confidentiality, visit the [Network Advertising Initiative website](https://thenai.org/) or the [Digital Advertising Alliance website](https://digitaladvertisingalliance.org/).

The use of online tracking mechanisms by third parties is subject to those third parties’ own privacy policies, and not this Cookie Policy. If you prefer to prevent third parties from setting and accessing cookies on your computer or other device, you may set your browser to block cookies.  Additionally, you may remove yourself from the targeted advertising of companies within the Network Advertising Initiative by opting out [here](https://thenai.org/opt-out/), or of companies participating in the Digital Advertising Alliance by opting out [here](https://optout.aboutads.info/). Although our Site currently does not respond to “do not track” browser headers, you can limit tracking through these third-party programs and by taking the other steps discussed above.

You may also opt-out of interest-based advertising by adjusting the advertising preferences on your mobile device (for example, in iOS, visit Settings > Privacy > Advertising > Limit Ad Tracking, and in Android, visit Settings > Google > Ads > Opt out of interest-based ads). Additionally, you may opt out for companies that participate in the Digital Advertising Alliance’s AppChoices tool by [downloading it here](https://youradchoices.com/AppChoices) and following the instructions in the app.
