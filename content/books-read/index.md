### Technofeudalism - Yanis Varoufakis

Varoufakis argues that capitalism is dead and has been replaced by a new feudal-like system built by big tech and finance, which he calls technofeudalism. The book is touchingly written in dialogue with his late father, and compellingly recasts a problem we all recognise in a new light. These are ideas that stick with you. 

Read Platform Capitalism by Nick Srnicek as a companion. 

### Living Better - Alastair Campbell

A candid personal account of Alastair's struggle with depression. He shares practical advice for sufferers and their families. While this is certainly an interesting insight into the life and mind of the public figure, I do wish the book had gone further into the current medical understanding of depression, relying less on personal perspective.

### Hyperion

Brilliant. A group of travellers share their stories while taking a pilgrimage through an alien world. This is my favourite type of science fiction, blending complex politics with far-future technology and strong social commentary. The stories told by the travellers provide multiple genres-within-a-genre, building a compelling mythology which promises a resolution through the sequels. 

### Fall of Civilisations 

Providing near-identical content to the podcast of the same name, the book explores the history of lost cultures and the reasons for their collapse. Including supporting maps and photographs does give the book an edge over the podcasts, though overall, Paul’s enthusiasm and imagery is presented best in the podcast. 

### The Bright Side

I really enjoyed this. Drawing upon scientific research and classical history, this is a meticulous dissection of optimism. The book makes the case for why, with infinite potential futures ahead, an optimistic outlook is a successful strategy for achieving the “best of all possible worlds”.

### The Burnout Society 

A short but profound book. Diagnosing the societal cause of mental health issues like burnout, anxiety and depression. Han’s thesis is that freedom under capitalism forces us to self-police ourselves as agents in the free market. Such that we compel ourselves to produce ever more at the expense of our own health. That we exploit ourselves to the point of burnout. We are both “perpetrator and victim, master and slave”. As an aside, this diagnosis is an example of meta-modern thinking, which I feel is a necessary to develop solutions to the problem.

### The Elements of Eloquence 

A fun little book. A light-hearted run around the linguistic block covering a rarely discussed corner of rhetoric. Describing, with examples, 39 different turns of phrase. Explains what makes them special and why they’re so effective. Enjoyable to read, insightful as reference. The book is let down only by the near-unpronounceable titles. 


## November 2024

### Orbital

Struggled with this one. While the descriptions of a day in the life aboard the ISS were evocative, something in the writing style pushed me away rather than drew me in. I found I had to work quite hard to hold my attention in the story. Perhaps it was the mix of third and second person, or the stream-of-consciousness like prose, that I found challenging. I’m a little disappointed. Wanted to enjoy this more than I did. 

### Micky 7

A colourful sci-fi romp. Great setup with a crew of characters terraforming a frozen alien world. Between the accidental double-cloning of the main character and encounters with a native species, the book probes questions of sentience and identity in a funny, camping adventure. Really enjoyable. 

### Against the Grain

An up-to-date account of early human civilisations. Challenging conventional understanding of the earliest states with contemporary science, while painting vivid imagery of the lives of people who lives in those times. Common assumptions about agriculture, states and complex societies being mutually dependent are not supported by the evidence. A real eye-opener about the variety of ways humans lived millennia ago. 

### The Mountain Under the Sea

A beautiful book. Exploring the nature of consciousness through a cast of characters in a future world of big corporations, AI slave ships, robots and the discovery of an octopus society. Two unconnected stories follow divergent paths as we explore this world until they collide together in a satisfying finale. Top-class sci-fi. 

## October 2024

### Ball Lighting 

The less well known quasi-prequel to the three-body problem series. A good, if a little over-fanciful, hard-sci-fi setup raising questions about the nature of the universe. With familiar character types and backgrounds from his other work, Liu plays pleasurably in fictional science. 

### 1Q84

An enticing mystery that deliberately fails to answer all the questions it poses. Assassins, blackmail, cult leaders and hitmen compete in a world that may, or may not, be ours. While at times the writing is repetitive, and there are problems with the writing of female characters, the book is fast paced and exciting throughout. Enjoyable, if flawed.
