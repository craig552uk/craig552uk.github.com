## May 2025

### Consider Phlebas - Iain M. Banks

Ongoing...

## April 2025

### The Dawn of Everything: A New History of Humanity - David Graeber & David Wengrow

Re-reading this gem of a book takes me a while as it's dense with fascinating ideas. The authors being by asking "what is the origin of inequality" before swifty dismissing it in favour of a more interesting questions - "how might people have lived in the past?" and "why do we find it so difficult to imagine a society different from our own?". Hard-going, but so very worth it. 

## March 2025

### Solaris - Stanisław Lem

Masterful.

## February 2025

### On Writing - Stephen King

A first-class book on the craft of writing from a first-class writer.

### Technofeudalism - Yanis Varoufakis

Varoufakis argues that capitalism is dead and has been replaced by a new feudal-like system built by big tech and finance, which he calls technofeudalism. The book is touchingly written in dialogue with his late father, and compellingly recasts a problem we all recognise in a new light. These are ideas that stick with you. 

Read Platform Capitalism by Nick Srnicek as a companion. 

### Living Better - Alastair Campbell

A candid personal account of Alastair's struggle with depression. He shares practical advice for sufferers and their families. While this is certainly an interesting insight into the life and mind of the public figure, I do wish the book had gone further into the current medical understanding of depression, relying less on personal perspective.

## January 2025

### Hyperion

Brilliant. A group of travellers share their stories while taking a pilgrimage through an alien world. This is my favourite type of science fiction, blending complex politics with far-future technology and strong social commentary. The stories told by the travellers provide multiple genres-within-a-genre, building a compelling mythology which promises a resolution through the sequels. 

### Fall of Civilisations 

Providing near-identical content to the podcast of the same name, the book explores the history of lost cultures and the reasons for their collapse. Including supporting maps and photographs does give the book an edge over the podcasts, though overall, Paul’s enthusiasm and imagery is presented best in the podcast. 

### The Bright Side

I really enjoyed this. Drawing upon scientific research and classical history, this is a meticulous dissection of optimism. The book makes the case for why, with infinite potential futures ahead, an optimistic outlook is a successful strategy for achieving the “best of all possible worlds”.

## December 2024

### The Burnout Society 

A short but profound book. Diagnosing the societal cause of mental health issues like burnout, anxiety and depression. Han’s thesis is that freedom under capitalism forces us to self-police ourselves as agents in the free market. Such that we compel ourselves to produce ever more at the expense of our own health. That we exploit ourselves to the point of burnout. We are both “perpetrator and victim, master and slave”. As an aside, this diagnosis is an example of meta-modern thinking, which I feel is a necessary to develop solutions to the problem.

### The Elements of Eloquence 

A fun little book. A light-hearted run around the linguistic block covering a rarely discussed corner of rhetoric. Describing, with examples, 39 different turns of phrase. Explains what makes them special and why they’re so effective. Enjoyable to read, insightful as reference. The book is let down only by the near-unpronounceable titles. 


## November 2024

### Orbital

Struggled with this one. While the descriptions of a day in the life aboard the ISS were evocative, something in the writing style pushed me away rather than drew me in. I found I had to work quite hard to hold my attention in the story. Perhaps it was the mix of third and second person, or the stream-of-consciousness like prose, that I found challenging. I’m a little disappointed. Wanted to enjoy this more than I did. 

### Micky 7

A colourful sci-fi romp. Great setup with a crew of characters terraforming a frozen alien world. Between the accidental double-cloning of the main character and encounters with a native species, the book probes questions of sentience and identity in a funny, camping adventure. Really enjoyable. 

### Against the Grain

An up-to-date account of early human civilisations. Challenging conventional understanding of the earliest states with contemporary science, while painting vivid imagery of the lives of people who lives in those times. Common assumptions about agriculture, states and complex societies being mutually dependent are not supported by the evidence. A real eye-opener about the variety of ways humans lived millennia ago. 

### The Mountain Under the Sea

A beautiful book. Exploring the nature of consciousness through a cast of characters in a future world of big corporations, AI slave ships, robots and the discovery of an octopus society. Two unconnected stories follow divergent paths as we explore this world until they collide together in a satisfying finale. Top-class sci-fi. 

## October 2024

### Ball Lighting 

The less well known quasi-prequel to the three-body problem series. A good, if a little over-fanciful, hard-sci-fi setup raising questions about the nature of the universe. With familiar character types and backgrounds from his other work, Liu plays pleasurably in fictional science. 

### 1Q84

An enticing mystery that deliberately fails to answer all the questions it poses. Assassins, blackmail, cult leaders and hitmen compete in a world that may, or may not, be ours. While at times the writing is repetitive, and there are problems with the writing of female characters, the book is fast paced and exciting throughout. Enjoyable, if flawed. 

## Older Reads

These are books I've read at some point before I began keeping this list. I've included them here because when people ask me for book recommendations these are usually the ones I'd suggest, as they've had the greatest influence on my own thinking. I'll add notes to this list as-and-when I get around to it.

### 1984 - George Orwell

Not only is this the archetypal dystopian thriller but also a stunningly prescient forecast of surveillance society. You know that this book is a cultural touchstone, because you've already heard of it.

### A Short History of Nearly Everything - Bill Bryson

"I want to learn about science, but don't know here to start", you ask. I answer with this. Bryson takes us on a comprehensive, but accessible, tour of modern scientific thinking. While now a little out of date, it's still a fantastic springboard into a vast range of topics. Start here and follow your curiosity.

### After the Ice: A Global Human History, 20,000–5000 BC - Steven Mithen

What were human lives like between the end of the last ice age (yes I know _technically_ we're still in an ice age but shush) and the start of recorded history. This is a fascinating and detailed account of a period of human history that we still know very little about.

### Animal Farm - George Orwell

Orwell again. If you read 1984 and thought _this bloke is good_, go here next. Sharp, funny and biting, this satire of communism is a relevant today as ever. Read alongside The Communist Manifesto.

### Capital in the Twenty-First Century - Thomas Piketty

Hard going, but if you want to understand inequality under capitalism, this is the place to start. Hugely influential, both in and out of established economics, this book brings rigour and evidence to the problem.

### Debt, The First 5000 Years - David Graeber

This is one of my top desert-island books. Graeber takes an anthropologists eye to the history of money and debt, showing that our common beliefs about the nature of both are wrong. More than any other, I credit this book with giving me an understanding that our world can take (and may have taken) forms far more varied than we give ourselves permission to imagine. Masterful.

### Dune - Frank Herbert

In my view, this is the bible of space opera. All others came from Dune. Not only is the world building beautiful, the character dynamics complex and the politics thrilling, but the ending is cataclysmic. You may have seen the films, do yourself a favour and visit Arrakis properly in the books 


### Factfulness - Hans Rosling

Humans live much better today than at any time in our history. This is the message Rosling brings to us. With evidence and data he enthusiastically shows us that the world is a much better place than we may fear. He sadly died before the book was published, but see him in action in his [many TED talks](https://www.ted.com/playlists/474/the_best_hans_rosling_talks_yo). [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org) is the spiritual successor to his work

### Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid - Douglas R. Hofstadter

Hofstadter's thesis is that self-awareness is a product of the mind's self-referential capability, what he calls "a strange loop". But this is no academic text book. The complex topic is explored with a series of allegories, building from first principles into a quasi-fantastical explanation of the human mind.

### The World Without Us - Alan Wiseman

If all us humans disappeared in an instant, what would we leave behind? And what would happen to the world? A fascinating read in it's own right, but also a valuable reference point for anyone who enjoys reading or writing (especially writing) post-apocalyptic fiction.
