10 Months Old
==============
While she played in the world  
man-handling it with wonder.

While she felt the moist grass  
on her hands and on her finger tips.

While she followed a crawling speck  
extending her finger to meet it.

While she grinned at the wind  
in her face and in her hair and in her ears.

Glowing admirers obit around her.  
Shining encouraging eyes.  
Warming tender words.

and she  
ignored their words,

and she  
ignored their eyes,

and she  
ignored their hopes,

and she  
took that moment as her own.
