# A Young Cyclist with an iPad

She rolls to a halt. Pausing to address her congregation,

an audience assembled by filaments of information.

Seated in pews of touch-screen devices,

they must anticipate her knowledge, her wisdom, her insights.

From high on her lecturn, a thought, she carefully crafts.

Then, after hesitating, delivers her broadcast.

She waits a minute or two for the first few replies.

Briefly deflated, she cradles her cherished by her side.

Now, with her sermon transmitted, she remounts her seat,

and rides on, awaiting praise, glory and re-tweets.
