there is no starting point, to understand the future we must look at the expected changes across many different domains, and find a way to integrate these forecasts into the best possible of all worlds.



- environment
  - the earth is warming, and will continue to warm
  - climate change will affect different regions differently. but what is common is that all regions will have to withstand greater environmental stresses than ever before. 
  - Regions will need to adopt different strategies to adapt to climate change.
  - geographically disperse regions will need to share knowledge and experience to similar problems.
  - expected billions of climate refugees in the next decades, as people are forced to leave their homes.
  - whatever the future hold, we must both adapt to inevitable environmental changes and move to a sustainable relationship with our planet

- energy
  - fossil fuel ROI diminishing
  - renewable costs falling
  - solar rollout has exceeded expectations year on year
  - low cost, abundant energy
  - this before considering market-viable fusion power
  - potential to generate energy at multiple times current demand, enabling transformative changes in many other domains

- materials
  - labour cost fall as robotics and automation increase
  - automated recycling of materials will increase material abundance and encourage recyclable product designs
  - whole-product market cost
    - tax on difficult to recycle products and materials
    - standards on recyclable products, with tax incentives
    - encourage greater transparency over supply chains
  - potential to build truly sustainable resource use, minimising our impact on the environment while expanding the availability of products to the population

- transport
  - EV car popularity
  - logistics infrastructure shipping oil, coal, gas will become redundant
  - prevalence of remote working and technologies to support it, reduce need for commuting
  - in the future there will be less demand on transportation
  - potential to improve well-being while reducing our environmental impact

- food
  - one third of land used to produce food
  - changes in consumption habits
  - farming techniques with higher yields
  - advance food manufacture
  - reducing food waste
  - improving quality of food produced
  - non-UPF foods
  - potential to increase volume and quality of food supply, while decreasing land use and international shipping

- population
  - global population if growing, but ageing
  - birth rates falling, population will cap out at 10.4 billion then begin to fall
  - we will first encounter a much reduced working age population as a proportion of the total, then a reduced population overall
  - shift in attitudes to immigration
    - immigration is an economic asset, and not a cultural threat
  - reduced labour pool, but also reduced labour demand
  - majority of the population will be dependent on the minority.
    - needs new politics, economics
    - we must accept this, as we may easily find ourselves dependent on others
  - potential to develop a politics and economics that is supportive of those in need while minimising the time spent working
  - conversely, reducing the requirement to work, may increase the availability of workers as those who are unable to work full time are able to seek opportunities in the workplace

- information
  - internet allows us to produce and share information like never before
  - opportunities for mis-information, fake news, and polarisation increase
  - the role of "the platform" as gatekeeper to information, mostly incentivised by advertising revenue and maximising engagement
  - what is a "platform"?
  - many platforms work to create consensus, not division, operating on different incentives - Wikipedia, BlueSky
  - incentivise platforms to increase exposure to opposing viewpoints and build understanding and consensus on issues
  - recognising that many of the issues we will face in the future, require a collective sense of responsibility and action
  - safely sharing information can make society more efficient and effective for all. but this must be done responsibly and safely, with respect for the rights of data subject and creative industries.
  - especially mindful of the risks of data bias, with bias in data sources amplified by automated systems what utilise that data. mistake to assume that data is representative.

- politics
  - democracy is receding
  - far-right advancing
  - polarisation
  - advertising driven social media
  - people look for easy answers to complex questions
  - exploited by opportunists
  - not a defence of status quo
  - chance to build a new politics

- Economics
  - post-capitalism
  - failure of "infinite growth" economic policy
  - inherent conflict between sustainability and growth

- values
  - pro migration
  - anti-nationalism

- Conclusion
  - The question is not if the future will arrive, but _which_ future will arrive.
  - Of all the possible futures we may find ourselves in, we should aim for the best possible future
  - Understanding the changes that are occurring around us, what we can expect, helps us to imagine how the future could look. and in doing so, choose which we want for ourselves and work to bring it about.
  - We must ask if our current values, politics and economics create the right incentives to bring about a better world.
  - I'll save a deeper dive on this for another post, but for now suffice to say that I do not believe that this is the case.
