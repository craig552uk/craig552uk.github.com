# Amazon is a Soviet State

Amazon is a new type of state, and it's territory is the platform.

The platform is a digital state, and like all nation states before, it extracts value by 

## If it's a state, who are it's citizens?

- Employees
- Shareholders
- Buyers
- Sellers

Employees are the smallest group, and have an employer/employee relationship with Amazon. They work for the company, but are by far the smallest population who do. Most people who work for Amazon, are not paid for their labour. Most people who work for Amazon, pay them.

Shareholders are a large group, possibly second largest. We think of shareholders as being suited men in glass and steel offices, but Amazon's shares are held by a vast number of people, mostly through their pensions. I am (indirectly) an Amazon shareholder, and chances are that you are too. Shareholding binds us all the the success of Amazon, such that we gain financially, while we lose out in other areas.

Buyers, or customers, browse amazon for free to find the products and services they want. Buyers pay for their products, Amazon handles the exchange and takes a cut for itself. Buyers are free to purchase products form elsewhere, but as Amazon is the largest retailer by far, chances are most buyers find what they want in Amazon, and won't have looked anywhere else. In this way buyers lock themselves in to Amazon. Like an open prison, they are free to leave at any time, but don't - it's easier to stay.

Sellers offer their products and services to customers through Amazon. They can chose to sell elsewhere (and may do), but Amazon grants the largest access to customers, and for most leaving would be too great a cost to bear.

This is the network effect property of platforms.

## Why is amazon a soviet state?

Under capitalism, most companies are outwardly capitalist, but inwardly dictatorships. With the exception of employee owned organisations like cooperatives, most companies are owned by their shareholders who have (near) absolute authority to set the rules with which they operate. This is considered normal for businesses, but if these businesses were nations, we'd call them dictatorships.

## Where are the platform states?

The platform is ephemeral, it is digital, it does not exist in the physical world, nor does it exist in any nation state. While the servers that run it, are physical, and do exist in different territories, the platform itself exists across all these and may move between them effortlessly. Physical presence in a territory may be conditional on access to the buyers and sellers in that state (as per data protection law) but if the value of courting these buyers and sellers is lost, the platform can abandon the server farms within the territory without harm to itself. Like an octopus severing a tentacle. This resilience, is a fundamental property of the internet, and exists by design.

## What can nation states do?

Nation states should treat Amazon and co. as the platform states that they are. They should enforce trade agreements with them as they do with nation states. And if they refuse, they should be evicted and their role in society replaced with state backed institutions providing the same. Trade agreements allow them to impose tariffs and set limits or targets on goods and services. This is exactly what China did.

If nations states continue to treat multi-nationals as mere companies, they will continue to be exploited by their globalised nimbleness. But in recognising them as platform states, nations states can stem the flow of value extraction away from their citizens.
