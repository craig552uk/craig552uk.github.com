==intro==

Firstly there's the logical argument. By definition, the optimist expects more from their future than the pessimist. Where the pessimist has resigned themselves to expect little (or less) from tomorrow than today, the optimist believes that tomorrow will be brighter. Consequently the pessimist does not see the point in working to improve the future, so does not try. As their lot does not improve, their situation becomes self-fulling, and they become victims of their own confirmation bias.

Whereas the optimist, who expects in a brighter future, is more inclined to prepare for it, to work for it. While they may not always succeed

## Is optimism naive?



Going into 2025 a lot of us are feeling bleak about the future. But I don't, I am optimistic for our future, and want to give you reasons to feel optimistic too.

They say history doesn't move in straight lines, and I take a long view of progress. While year to year things may be a better or worse than recently, the long term trends are clear, for most people, the world is better today then ever before.

In the last two centuries, the lives of people across the world have been improved far more than at any other point in our history. This is all the more amazing considering that there are more of us now than ever before. Following the industrial revolution in the early 18<sup>th</sup> century, Quality of life improved, childhood mortality fell, and with it population figures rose. This demonstrates that it well within our means to provide a better life for all people around the world.

The question is not if we _can_ but if we can _continue_.

Margaret Atwood said "writing a book is an act of optimism" [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDkbyyPRKFY]

If you want change, optimism is rational. If you believe that the future can be better than today, you'll work to improve your situation. While you may fail, you may sometime succeed. But if you don't believe your prospects can improve, you'll never even try. If nothing else, optimists fare better than pessimists.

The optimist is compelled to care for the future.

Asa an optimist, you don;t need to know _how_ the future will be better, it is enough to simple believe that it will be. This alone will guide your decisions to help bring it about.

Pessimism is self-fulling.

The optimist must see themselves as part of a bigger change. Small decisions can accumulate over time into large effects. The daily interactions of the optimist can bring about large positive changes. While we can be more concise in our goals and the actions we take to bring them about, it is enough for the optimist to simply view the world as having the potential to change for the better.
