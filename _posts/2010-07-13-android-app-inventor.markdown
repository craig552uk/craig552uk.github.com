Google have launched a handy tool for building Android Apps without requiring any programming knowledge. It's called <a href="http://appinventor.googlelabs.com/about/">App Inventor</a> and is built upon the <a href="http://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/41550">Open Blocks</a> platform. With it you can create mobile apps simply by dragging and dropping program 'blocks' in to place, similar to Lego Mindstorms. The video makes it look pretty simple.

I wouldn't expect that apps made using App Inventor would be better (faster, more efficient) than their hand-coded equivalents, but I can see that this would be useful for quickly knocking up a demo or for scratching out ideas. It's clear from the blabber that Google aren't trying to put developers out of work, this is aimed squarely at educators as a platform to teach about programming concepts. A good thing in my books.

Google will be granting access to App Inventor over the coming weeks, you need to <a href="https://services.google.com/fb/forms/appinventorinterest/">register</a> to get an invite.
