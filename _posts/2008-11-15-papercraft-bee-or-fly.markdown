I blogged about Elsa Mora a few weeks back. I absolutely loved the <a href="http://www.etsy.com/view_listing.php?listing_id=16528008">papercraft bee</a> she's made, and I had to try something similar.

<a href="http://www.craig-russell.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/bee.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-144 alignc" title="bee" src="http://www.craig-russell.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/bee.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="420" /></a>

My attempt isn't as good, it actually looks more like a fly, but never the less I'm pretty pleased with it. I've mounted it on yellow card in a box frame, it now adorns my office wall.
