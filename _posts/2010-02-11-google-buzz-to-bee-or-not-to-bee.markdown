Aside from an excuse for that spectacularly witty title, I felt the need to share my mixed feeling about Google Buzz. My mind is favouring the list approach to ordering thoughts today, so here's my pros and cons from a day-or-so of use.

## Cons ##

*  Takes pig ages to pick up updates in Twitter, Flickr and wot not. Real-time? Nah.
*  Sticks it's fingers in its ears and makes a "La La La" noise at he suggestion of Facebook integration
*  Equally ignorant to Ning. Not really surprising though, Ning's a bit niche.
*  Twitter followers arn't imported
*  Less of a social aggregator, more of an extra thing to keep track of.

## Pros ##

*  GMail style conversations - badly needed in Twitter

Gonna keep with it for now, but I expect it'll be more effort than it's worth.
