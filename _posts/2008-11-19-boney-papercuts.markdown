Papercutting pictures is a relatively common technique, but one that I'd not tried before, here's my attempts.
<p class="alignc"><a href="http://www.craig-russell.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/skel.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-146" title="skel" src="http://www.craig-russell.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/skel.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="680" /></a></p>

This papercut is absed upon a <a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/exhibition/dreamanatomy/da_g_I-A-1-01.html">medieval anatomical woodcut</a>.

This one is based upon a picture from <a href="http://www.bartleby.com/107/">Greys Anatomy</a>.
