I don't often cross post between blogs, but for this one I'll make an exception.

I keep a blog about authentication and authorisation as part of my day job looking after the identity management system at De Montfort University. I recently wrote about how most passwords we use are easy to remember but insecure, and offered a strategy to create secure, memorable passwords for your accounts.

<blockquote>A strong password might look something like fmD!dG4dAm. It's 10 characters long, 8 is a reasonable minimum but the longer the better. It uses a mixture of upper-case, lower-case, numbers and punctuation marks. It isn't a dictionary word. All this makes it quite a secure password that is hard to guess. And hard to remember too right?

Wrong! This password is actually very easy to remember, because of the system used to generate it.</blockquote>

Also, if you're looking to implement a password policy in PHP, you might want to take a look at my <a href="http://craig552uk.github.com/password-policy/">PHP Password Policy library on GitHub</a>.
