This isn't new, but I've never read it before, and maybe you haven't either. Jeff Rudell is a paper sculptor in the US and regular contributor to <a href="http://www.craftstylish.com">CraftStylish.com</a>, where he offers various papercraft projects.

In his article "<a href="http://www.craftstylish.com/item/5787/depth-charge-how-to-make-a-splash-and-get-paid-for-it">Depth Charge: How to Make a Splash and Get Paid for it</a>", he talks about how he went from papercrafting as an evening hobby to papercrafting as a full time career.
<blockquote>"Despite not know where I was headed, I felt pretty confident that I would need a portfolio of work to show people whenever I got to wherever I was going. So I set out to hone my skills and build up a body of work that showed both my interests and my range."</blockquote>
I know I'm not the only one who dreams of ditching my 9-5 and getting paid to do something that really excites me. However, wether I will or not is another thing. Either way I like to read "how I made it" stories, it makes that dream life feel a little closer.
