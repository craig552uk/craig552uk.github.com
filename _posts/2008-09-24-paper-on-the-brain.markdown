I like Paper Craft. I like Psychology. If only there was some way of combining the two...
Wait! What's this!
<p class="alignc"><a href="http://www.craig-russell.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/paperbrain.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-27" title="paperbrain" src="http://www.craig-russell.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/paperbrain.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="295" /></a></p>
Martin Pyka has produced this <a href="http://www.martinpyka.de/2008/09/09/gehirnatlas-zum-selberbasteln/">awesome model of the brain</a>, with all the different regions labeled up. His site's written in German, but the model itself is printed with the English (and Latin) names for the brain regions.

I think I'll be adding this one to the collection tonight.
