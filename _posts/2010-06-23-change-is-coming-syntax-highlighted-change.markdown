After the recent release of <a href="http://wordpress.org/">Wordpress 3.0</a>, I've decided to redesign my site taking in to account some of the <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Version_3.0">fantastic new features</a> it has to offer (more on that in a future post). But while I was hunting around for bits and bobs I found out about the <a href="http://alexgorbatchev.com/wiki/SyntaxHighlighter">marvellous syntax highlighter project</a>, which allows me to do funky crap like this...

<pre lang="bash" line="1">
while read LINE; do
   echo $LINE
done &lt; $0
</pre>

Rather handily the highlighter script has been <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/syntaxhighlighter/">wrapped in to widget</a> (several actually) for easily jamming in to Wordpress.

Laters!

P.S. That script is my attempt at a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quine_%28computing%29">Quine</a>, a cheat I know, but it was the first code sample that jumped in to my head while I was writing.

<strong>EDIT</strong> <em>April 2011</em>: <a href="http://www.craig-russell.co.uk/new-site-design/">I'm now using a different plugin for syntax highlighting</a>
