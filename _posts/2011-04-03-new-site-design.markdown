Today I've made the first of a series of changes that are coming to my website over the next few months.

I've wanted to update the Wordpress theme for a while. The previous theme was coded a while ago, and a lot of great changes have swept across the web since then. I've taken the time to time to integrate various technologies like a <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/responsive-web-design/">responsive layout</a>, <a href="http://dev.twitter.com/pages/intents">improved twitter integration</a> and a (hopefully) more <a href="http://www.craig-russell.co.uk/contact/">reliable spam email filter</a>.

I've also stopped using the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/syntaxhighlighter/">syntax highlighter evolved</a> plugin in favour of <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-syntax/">wp-syntax</a>. I think that the latter has a much cleaner style than the former. Because of this I'm having to update every blog post that includes code to support the new plugin. Please bear with me while I do this.

My site used to put a lot of emphasis on my paper toys, these now have a <a href="http://craig-russell.co.uk/papertoy/">dedicated mini-site</a>. This will soon have it's own URL, but for now lives in a sub-folder.

There's a few more changes yet to come, but I'll post more about that when the time is right.

I've tested it pretty throughly, but if you happen to encounter any problems when using the site, <a href="http://www.craig-russell.co.uk/contact/">do let me know</a>.
