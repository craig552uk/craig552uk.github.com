Earlier this month was the 50th anniversary for Blue Peter. I loved the show as a child, mainly for the makes. To mark the occasion The Times devoted an entire supplement to some of the best makes from the show, including the famed Tracy Island make. There's also an interview with Margaret Parnell, the woman who, for over 40 years, was responsible for creating makes for the show.

> ...She sent the show some blue crepe dolls' hats, with step-by-step instructions on how to make them. She received a letter back... "It said that they liked them and would use them in the show that week, and did I have any more ideas. Seven hundred toys and 41 years later, I was still making things for them."

It's a lovely little read, which for me bought back many happy memories of wrestling with cereal packets, sticky tape and glue. I am however disappointed not to see my favorite make in there, the Ninja Turtles play set, it had a secret man-hole cover and everything!

Blue Peter makes, and making stuff in general, certainly played a big part in my childhood. Actually I still spend a fair amount of my time making stuff now. Ah well, here's to not growing up!
