Well, I upgraded my <a href="http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/product?product=4099549&amp;lc=en&amp;cc=uk&amp;dlc=en&amp;lang=en&amp;tmp_track_link=ot_we/prodlink/en_uk/4099549/loc:0&amp;cc=uk">laptop</a> to the latest release of <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a>, and what can I say? Everything just works.

All of the <a href="http://www.craig-russell.co.uk/installing-ubuntu-9-10-on-hp-g61-laptop/">issues I'd identified</a> with 9.10 are no problem with 10.4. Although I should add that this was an upgrade, not a clean install, so it may be the case that my previous fixes were carried on through the upgrade. But either way, Ubuntu 10.4 on the G61 <a href="http://www.pcpro.co.uk/blogs/2010/03/23/ubuntu-10-4-beta-is-bloody-brilliant/">is a charm</a>.

Except that the boot screen is purple. Meugh!
