Recently I've been scratching my way around Google looking for some of the interesting things that people have been doing with paper. Here's some that really caught my eye...

<a href="http://www.petercallesen.com/"><strong>Peter Callesen</strong></a> - Well known paper sculptor, his A4 papercuts are truly inspiring.

<a href="http://www.jenstark.com/"><strong>Jen Stark</strong></a> - Jen plays with multicoloured paper, creating complex dynamic forms out of simple repeated cuts. Really beautiful, and sometimes strangely organic.

<a href="http://www.richardsweeney.co.uk/"><strong>Richard Sweeney</strong></a> - Richard really explores the geometric possibilities of the material. The complex shapes he creates, sometimes evoke the sensation of fabric, flowing water and other materials.

<a href="http://www.papierarchitectuur.nl/"><strong>Ingrid Siliakus</strong></a> - Ingrid mainly produces architectural pieces. <a href="http://www.evermore.com/catalog/product_info.php?products_id=55">Her pop-ups</a> are truly impressive, and have inspired me to try something similar.

<a href="http://www.clivestevenssculpture.com/"><strong>Clive Stevens </strong></a>- Clive's work beautifully creates a depth and volume to the animals and scenes he creates.

<a href="http://www.carlosnmolina.com/"><strong>Carlos N Molina</strong></a> - Carlos creates wonderfuly colourful characters. His site also includes videos and tutorials showing his work process.

<strong><a href="http://www.sherchristopher.com/">Sher Christopher</a></strong> - Sher also creates characters, though hers have a gritty realism, and a real sense of identity about them.

<a href="http://www.elsita.typepad.com/"><strong>Elsa Mora</strong></a> - Elsa's paper crafts have a fragile elegancy. Her <a href="http://www.etsy.com/view_listing.php?listing_id=16528008">paper bee</a> is fantastic.

Here's a few more artists worth checking out too...
