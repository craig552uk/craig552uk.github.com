title: Argue for SEO if You Can't Argue for Open Data
description:

This post is for any one who cares about open data and works in a company web team.

If you've tried calling for open data at your organisation but haven't had much luck, here are a few things to thing about:

1.  Your senior staff probably don't know what open data is and probably wouldn't care if they did.
2.  They probably do know that your website brings in customers and that SEO is important.
3.  Good SEO requires a good site structure and good mark-up.
4.  A well-structured site with good mark-up can be scraped.

If you can't get anyone to care about open data, it's not the end of the road.
Put your efforts in to making your web site well organised, with good clean mark-up.

Make it easy for others to scrape the information on your site.
Or better yet, scrape it yourself and publish the dataset.
