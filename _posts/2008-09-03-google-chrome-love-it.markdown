I've just installed [Google Chrome][1], their new web browser, and it's pretty damn good. It's got the usual array of innovative features, you'd expect from a Google product. 

They've clearly given some thought towards how the web is used these days. I love that you can [drag tabs][2] in and out of windows, it's a great feature that makes managing windows so much easier. I like that you can create [application shortcuts][3] for your favourite web apps, further blurring the line between locally installed and web-based programs. though I would like to be able to drag application windows in and out of main browser windows.

There's also lost of other little features that you may not notice. Some of my favourites are "Close tabs opened by this tab" on the tab right click menu, the bug reporting tool on the page menu and the neat integration with Google Gears (look out for the promt when logging in to other Google Apps). But for me, Google Chrome has got rid of the number one issue I have with Firefox - **it doesn't promt to remember login details until AFTER you have successfully logged in to a site!**

I like Google Chrome, it's neat, it's tidy, (it's open source) and its flaming fast. But I'm not going to move away from Firefox just yet (for starters there's no linux version). It's got some good features, but it's no where near sufficiently feature-rich to use all the time. It doesn't even notice RSS Feeds!

I don't know if Google plans to develop Chrome in to a serious contender in the browser market. It's be odd for them to go up against Firefox, what with them working so closely recently. I think that Chrome is Google's way of giving browser innovation a kick up the arse. They're not saying "we can do it better", they're saying "it can be done better" and i think they're right.
