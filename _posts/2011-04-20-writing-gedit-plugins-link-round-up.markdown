If you want to write a plugin for Gedit, you've probably struggled to find any helpful tutorials and documentation. That's because there isn't much out there.

On my hunt, I've found the following few links to be worthwhile.

<a href="http://live.gnome.org/Gedit/PythonPluginHowTo">Python Plugin How To for gedit 3</a>

<a href="http://www.russellbeattie.com/blog/my-first-gedit-plugin">My first gedit plugin</a>

<a href="http://sp2hari.com/2007/11/08/gedit-plugin/">Gedit Plugin</a>

It'll also be worth checking this out.

<a href="http://pygtk.org/pygtk2tutorial/">PyGTK 2.0 Tutorial</a>

It's not much, but it's a start...
