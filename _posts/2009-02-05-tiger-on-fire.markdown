Henk from <a href="http://www.microdot.be/">microdot.be</a>, has got in touch about his "Paper Craft Stress Test" series. He's graciously selected my <a href="http://www.craig-russell.co.uk/papertoys/endangered-species/">Tiger model</a> to test it's strength against the most fearsome of classical Greek elements FIRE! As you can see, <a href="http://www.microdot.be/index.php/site/comments_english/papercraft_stress_test_tmcrpatents_pending_fire/">it didn't do too well</a>.
