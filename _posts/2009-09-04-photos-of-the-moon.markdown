A few weeks ago <a href="http://twitter.com/virtualleader">@VirtualLeader</a> (practically) gave me her old telescope. I've been itching to try it out but before now, but the weather has been against me. However, this evening I went out and took these photos of the moon. Not bad, considering I was just pointing a cheep digital camera down the eyepiece! Check out the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/craig552uk/sets/72157622281255678/">Flickr set here</a>.
