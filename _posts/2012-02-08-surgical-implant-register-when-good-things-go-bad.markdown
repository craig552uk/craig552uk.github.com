The recent <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/french-breast-implant-scandal" target="_blank">debacle over faulty breast implants</a> has raised calls for a national (or larger) <a href="http://doc2doc.bmj.com/forums/off-duty_news-media_should-there-compulsory-registries-medical-devices-implants" target="_blank">registry of surgical implants</a>. The argument being that patients could be directly contacted if it became necessary for their implants to be removed. This would undoubtedly be a good thing. Product recalls are difficult exercises, fought with problems, a central registry would certainly make a lot of patients lives easier and safer.

But lets think a little further ahead...

The technology for computer-powered implants is already with us and these devices will only become increasingly common in the future. There is a <a href="http://boingboing.net/2012/01/10/lockdown.html" target="_blank">real concern</a> that such devices will be locked-down, accessible only to the device manufacturer. The patient would be handing over control of part their body to a device that they would have no legal entitlement to access and assess.

This scares me.

But now imagine there is a database of every patient and every programmable implant they have in their bodies.

This scares me more.

Let's put aside any concerns of what would happen if this database fell in to the wrong hands and try not to think of a future where all implants are simultaneously remotely deactivated by nefarious individuals. Let us instead think about what it means for the patient if this list was in the hands of the implant manufacturers.

Think about all the worst things about closed systems and DRM. Add that to a device that you depend upon to stay alive. Then multiply it by a database of every patient that has one.

What if your doctor confidentially advises you get a diabetes implant, but the law says the manufacturer gets to know all about it too?

What if the Government decides that public health would be best served by installing monitoring software on every surgical implant, and they know the names and addresses of everyone who has one?

What if hearing-aids were subsidised by companies who knew everyone who wore one and broadcast adverts directly in to their ears?

As I said a the start, an implant register would be a great thing for patient health where faulty product recalls are concerned. However, with the growing use of programmable devices in implants, and the appalling track record of computing devices being used against their owners, we should be mindful of how such a database might be misappropriated in the future.
