A discussion has popped up on Nice Paper Toys about the relative merits of <a href="http://www.nicepapertoys.com/forum/topic/show?id=1905839%3ATopic%3A17749">selling paper toys</a>. Ben the Illustrator kicked things off asking for opinions on the issue, and any success stories from designers. The topic was picked up on <a href="http://toysrevil.blogspot.com/2008/09/selling-paper-toys-discussion-on.html">TOYS R EVIL</a>, which is where I gave <a href="http://toysrevil.blogspot.com/2008/09/selling-paper-toys-discussion-on.html?showComment=1221479040000#c7140425381718762232">my two pence</a>.

Having read through some of the comments, there's a bit of a divide over the issue. Some seem fervently against the idea of selling paper toys, and view free downloads as a cornerstone of what makes the community so appealing. Whereas others are more keen on exploring avenues where they may be able to make a living producing papertoys.

Personally I'd like to beleive that there are ways that designers can produce papertoys commercially, without fear of alienation from the rest of the papertoy community. <a href="http://www.nicepapertoys.com/forum/topic/show?id=1905839%3ATopic%3A17749&amp;page=1#desc_1905839Comment17815">TylerTT</a> mades some good suggestions about how papercraft may fit as part of a broader creative career.Â  But I'm more interested in how a designer might derive a revenue from their papercraft models alone.

I think that it is important that models should remain free to download, and that paid models should have some added value above a free PDF, to encourage paid customers and to avoid alienating the free download community. There are several mechanisms where this may be the case. A designer could offer free downloads in PDF, and sell models (through the mail) perhaps with high quality printing, on special patterened or coloured paper or (if he were famous enough) signed limited edition prints. This business model has seen some success from designers.

You could provide a limited run of pay only downloads, releasing the model for free after a number of sales. You could make part of a collection available for free periodically, while charging for the rest. Although both these models present obvious copyright management issues.

You could make special offers or exclusive models available to paying customers only. Promotional offers should be carefully selected, as there is a risk that you may not encourage repeat business.

Another isue is wether or not the papercraft community is able to support a commercial designer. Based upon some of the discussion responses, this may not yet be the case. <a href="http://www.nicepapertoys.com/xn/detail/1905839:Comment:17771">Matt Hawkins mentions</a> that he has so far only sold about 100 of the 250 <a href="http://custompapertoys.bigcartel.com/">Mechanical Man</a> prints he's had produced. What about outside the papertoy community? <a href="http://toysrevil.blogspot.com/2008/09/selling-paper-toys-discussion-on.html?showComment=1221468420000#c4983270496058673776">Ken Munk explains</a> that most designer toy collectors are only interested in ready made models, whereas the flat prints appeal more to graphic designers.
<blockquote>Well, my point was that these "packs" I did don't appeal to the toy crowd, but to another design-interested crowd.</blockquote>
Wherever you may stand on this issue, I'm sure that you'll agree with me, and with many of those who have discussed this issue, that while protecting the community is important, we have to encourage its growth in the future. And it looks like selling paper toys may become a larger part of it.
