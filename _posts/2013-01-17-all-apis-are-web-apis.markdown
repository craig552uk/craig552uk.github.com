title: All APIs are Web APIs Everything Else is Bullshit

The world is waking up to the idea of APIs. This is a good thing.

Some product owners are beginning to realise that customers may want to take data out of their system to use in new, unexpected ways. They are building web APIs in to their products, we love them for this. They are making our lives better. We are all moving forwards together.

However.

Some product owners do not understand this. Some product owners hear about this "API" thing and think it's just another feature requirement to check off the list. Some product owners think they have an API because their code base is open or because you can use Visual Studio to change the branding.

They are wrong.

Im my book, an API interfaces over a protocol. And 99% of the time, the web - HTTP - **should** be your protocol of choice (edge cases ignored for the purpose of rant).

If your "API" requires me to use a particular language - that you specify - then you do not have an API. You have a development library<sup>*</sup>.

All APIs are web APIs. Everything else is bullshit.
