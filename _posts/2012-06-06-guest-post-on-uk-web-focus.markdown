[Brian Kelly][2] (of UKOLN) invited me to write a guest post for his blog [UK Web Focus][3].

UKOLN host the [Institutional Web Management Workshop][4] conference, which I will be attending next month.

Universities have a strong history of academic collaboration, a practice that we in the corporate and support services should seek to emulate. By way of an example, I’d like to share my experiences of sharing a project of my own with the university community and the great benefit that this has returned.
