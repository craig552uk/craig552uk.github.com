title: Clearing 2012 Interactive Visualisation

Over the past few weeks I've been building an interactive to explore clearing this year.

Clearing is an annual process in the UK that pairs up students with university places.
The UK HE sector has undergone some changes in recent years and I thought it would be interesting to  explore some of the consequences.

Check out the **[Clearing 2012 Interactive Visualisation][1]** now!
