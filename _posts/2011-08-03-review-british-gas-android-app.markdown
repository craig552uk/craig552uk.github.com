It's not often I write reviews, but the new <a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=com.centrica.android.britishgas&feature=search_result">British Gas app for Android</a> has prompted me to do so. The app offers a curious mix of genuinely clever ideas and some glaring oversights. It's a beta release, so I'm writing this mainly to help the development team on their way. I'll keep this brief, because I hate long reviews.

<h2>The Good</h2>
The simple fact that this app now exists is the best thing about it. Submitting meter readings is a pain in the arse, made less painful and less arsey with this app. It's also (largely) easy to use, if you're already registered for on-line billing, just log in with your account details and that's it. Your account history, meter reading submission and all the other bells and whistles are there for you. Being able to compare your energy usage against the average for your area is a great idea and the information is displayed very nicely. Making people competitive about their energy use can only be a good thing. 

Access to support is great, you can fire off an email (expect a reply in 24 hour apparently) and important contact numbers are all easily accessible. Also, using the camera flash as a torch on the meter readings page is a wonderfully clever idea.

<h2>The Bad</h2>
I get prompted to log in a second time when trying to compare energy usage, which is annoying. And for this login (not the main one), my credentials aren't remembered. The comparison feature itself is quite fiddly to use, the app tries to download comparison data for most navigation gestures, which is frustrating.  To view the comparison results, you don't click the box labelled "click to compare" but the teeny tiny arrow next to it. Oddly the button on the information display is styled differently to the rest of the app, and looks out of place. In general the comparison feature doesn't feel very well integrated with the rest of the app, which is a shame.

While you can view your previous energy consumption in a table, it'd probably be more effective to see it in a chart. That you can't do this is all the more surprising considering the icon for this feature is a bar chart?! <strong>Update:</strong> <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/NeilSwanston/status/98768039629176833">I'm informed</a> that you can rotate the device to view data as a chart.

<h2>The Verdict</h2>
A great app, but needs a bit more work.

Well done British Gas. Looking forward to the alpha release.
