title: Scraping Tweets the Easy Way
description: Tweetstream - an easy to use tool for scraping tweets by user and/or keyword
---
Most organisations who are putting effort in to their social media presence will want to record and monitor the impact that their activities have. But collecting tweet data through the API to process can be fiddly.

I wrote a tool to take care of it - [Tweetstream][1]

Tweetstream is an easy to use tool to archive tweet and user data.

Tweetstream can be configured to archive tweets from a number of specified accounts and/or collect tweets that include defined keywords. It stores both tweet and user information in CSV files, which can be easily opened by a spreadsheet application or further processed and mined.

Tweetstream also has a built in spam filter, so your archive doesn't get swamped by noisy bots.

Checkout the [GitHub repository][1] for more information.
