Countless studies demonstrate that our brains are modular organs, divided up in regions specialised for certain tasks. Studies of patients who have suffered localised damage to the brain (from a stroke or tumor for example) have allowed scientists to map out the roles that different areas of the brain do. As science allows us to divide the function of the brain in to ever smalled pieces, the more a question forces itself to the surface. If my brain is made up of many different parts, why do I feel like a single person?

It seems like a contradiction; if the brain is a community of thought, where does the individual fit in? Or to rephrase: why does the mind form an integrated 'self' from the multiple processes of the brain?

From an evolutionary viewpoint there are three explanations. Firstly, that there is some adaptive advantage to an integrated identity, the second is that it has no adaptive value in itself, but it is associated from some element that does, the third is that it has no adaptive disadvantage and therfore it has not been selected out.

Many people who suffer from multiple personality disorders are able to engage in perfectly noraml, happy, productive lives. You could have met a sufferer and not even noticed. [get ref]
