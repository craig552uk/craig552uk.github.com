title: Thank You for a Wonderful Product Launch
description:
---
This morning I launched [easyopendata.com][1] upon the world, and it has been a wonderful day.

Easy Open Data enables you to publish custom-formatted XML feeds using data from your Google spreadsheets. Feeds are publicly listed on your profile and automatically updated when the spreadsheet is.

The actual "launch" consisted of little more than a couple of tweets and a dozen-odd emails to some people I knew (and some I didn't). The response has been wonderfully supportive.

I've had some really useful email/twitter conversations with various people about the future possibilities of the product and have identified the areas to develop next.

I was invited to [write a guest blog post about the product][2]. Which was a real surprise, especially on day 0. It is so encouraging when others offer you their platform to stand upon.

The sign-up rate has been phenominal. At the time of writing (9 hours after launch), almost 10% of (unique) visitors have chosen to sign up. This is incredibly heartening.

This post is really to thank everyone that I've spoken to today, your feedback has been invaluable. I also want to thank everyone who has signed up or even just taken a look. I certainly don't sign up for services lightly and I really appreciate the faith that has been shown towards me today.

This post is in danger of starting to sound too much like an oscar acceptance speach, so I'll end it here. 

But before I do, I want to end by saying how wonderful it is to recieve such a magnificent response - on the first day - for a project that has consumed the past three months. I am fueled by your response, you can expect to see many more exciting developments here in the future.

If you want to know what all the fuss is about, jump in now.
