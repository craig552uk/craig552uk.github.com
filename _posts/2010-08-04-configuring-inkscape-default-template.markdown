When I open up a new document in Inkscape, the first thing I usually do is set up the grids and page layout in mm for printing. This gets pretty boring having to do this with every new document.

Fortunately it's pretty easy to configure the default template so you don't have to do this.
<ol>
	<li>Open Inkscape</li>
	<li>Set up your blank sheet however you like</li>
	<li>Save the file in <pre lang="text">/home/username/.config/inkscape/templates/default.svg</pre></li>
</ol>
That's it!
