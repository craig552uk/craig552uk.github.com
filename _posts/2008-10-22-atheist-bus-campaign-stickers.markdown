A while back comedian <a href="http://arianesherine.blogspot.com/">Ariane Sherine</a>, wrote an <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/jun/20/transport.religion">article asking atheists to donate money</a> for an atheist ad campaign to respond to a recent christian campaign promising hellfire to nonbeleivers. Well it looks like <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/oct/21/religion-advertising">she's got the Â£11'000 she was after</a> and more, so these adverts will be rolling out across London some time soon.

Now, I don't live in London. In fact most people don't live in London. So I, and most other non-London types, won't ever see this campaign, which is a shame...

Wait one cotton picking, nose flicking, lolly licking minute! Why not print your own stickers, and slap them on every lamp post/ post box / hobo around!

You might want to print it on to a tee shirt, hat or cravat.
