When I'm building my models and I need to work out how to get one piece to exactly fit against another, I used to guess and make do with an aproximation, which sometimes works fine, but other times, really doesn't. So I went back to my old collage text books, and started poking around to see if I could actually calculate the sizes I needed. Now I've got a few methods which I rely on quite often, and I thought I'd share them with you. I'll go through a few common maths concepts for starters, stuff you'll use quite often, and then I'll run through a few examples. <!--more-->

Geometric maths can get a bit confusing, but I'm not going to use any thing that you can't do with the standard Windows calculator, which you can find in <strong>Start </strong>&gt; <strong>Programs </strong>&gt; <strong>Accessories </strong>&gt; <strong>Calculator</strong>. I'll refer to the Windows Calculator functions, as it's the most common platform out there. I don't have a Mac, so I don't know what functions are available in the Mac Calculator (if any one wants to help with this drop a comment below).

Also, some high-end graphics packages take care of some this stuff for you, but if like me, you only use free software, you may find this useful.
<h2>Useful Button</h2>
Before I start, here's one of the functions that we'll need to use...

<strong>Pi</strong> (Pronounced "Pie", also written <strong>∏</strong>)
This is shorthand for a number which pops up A LOT with circles, it's roughly equal to 3.14 . You'll need to click <strong>View </strong>&gt; <strong>Scientific </strong>to see the button in the Windows Calculator.
<h2>Create the end cap for a cylinder</h2>
A closed cylinder is made up of three components, one to make the tube, and two circles for the caps at each end. Here we're going to calculate the exact size of the end circle from the tube.

A tube is made from a rectangle of paper rolled up. Our cylinder will be 5cm long, so we'll need a tube made from a rectangle of paper which is 5cm long by 10cm wide.

Once rolled up, the tube will need a circluar end cap with a <em>circumference </em>of 10cm. The circumference is the distance around the edge of the circle. From the circumference we can work out the <em>radius </em>(or <em>diameter</em>) of the circle. The <em>radius </em>is the distance from the center of a circle to the edge, the <em>diameter </em>is twice this distance.

The diameter of a circle is calculated by dividing the circumference by ∏ (Pi), the radius is the diameter divided by two.

So for our cylinder we need a circle with a radius of 1.59cm and a diameter of 3.14cm. We can use this to set our graphics program to draw a circle which will fit our cylinder perfectly.

You can also work out the width of the tube piece from the diameter of the circle by multiplying the diameter by ∏.

This process can also be used to calculate the size of hole you'd need to cut, to insert a tube in to.

This is a pretty straight forward example, but one that I often use. Next week, I'll give a slightly more complicated, and significantly more useful, example.
