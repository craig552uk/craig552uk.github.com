title: Reflections on UK University Social Media

Last week, I published a [dataset listing UK university social media accounts][1]. I followed this up over the weekend with a fairly superficial, but never-the-less informative, [analysis of the dataset][2]. In this post I want to share some of the things I noticed about how universities are presenting their SM accounts while compiling this information.

Most universities have made their SM accounts easy to discover by including them on their home page. Most commonly links are presented as branded icons or buttons, either in the header or footer of the page (or occasionally both). In most cases these buttons link directly to the SM account. However, some institutions link to a 'directory' listing all SM accounts the university offers, for example [Heythrop][3] and [Glasgow][4]. I find the first approach preferable from a UI perspective, especially while compiling this dataset! Though the second acknowledges that a institution as large as a university will likely have many different presences on social networks, and aims to ease discovery by aggregating these links in a single location. Indeed, in cases where institutions have no single 'primary' account this is the only appropriate choice (e.g. the [QMW YouTube channels][8]).

On a similar point, it's worth noticing that many Welsh universities run multiple accounts for English and Welsh speaking customers (such as [Aberystwyth][9]). As universities increasingly move in to international markets, it will be interesting to see if this becomes more common for other languages.

Where these links do not appear on the  home page, they are typically found in the 'News and Events' or 'About' sections. The former implies that these institutions view SM as a channel through which to 'push' information out rather than as a two-way communication channel. Alternatively, it may simply reflect where responsibility for SM lays within the institution.

It's also good to see that most institutions are making use of v[anity URLs][10] where they are available. Only 10 of the listed Facebook accounts do not use a custom URL for their profile. All YouTube and Twitter accounts provide vanity URLs by default. It's also interesting to note the different ways in which institutions are using Flickr. Some link to a user's photos, others to a group of photos, and in one case to a search query.

These are just a few things I've noticed while compiling [this dataset][11] about how social media is being presented and used by UK universities. I'm interested to know what others think about this. Please do drop a comment below.
