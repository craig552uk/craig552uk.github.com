For a while now I've been looking for an X server for Windows, so that I can start X applications from within a secure shell. Up until now Hummingbird has a been a fair solution, but I've never been too impressed with it. I'd never been able to get it working with <a href="http://www.putty.org/">PuTTY</a>, so I have had to revert to Hummingbird's mediocre terminal client when I needed to run X apps. And when it's running it sits in the way on my (already over cluttered) task bar.

But not any more! I've found <a href="http://www.straightrunning.com/XmingNotes/">Xming</a>, which is brilliant. It's hardly new, but it's new to me, so I'm excited. It works wonderfully with <a href="http://www.putty.org/">PuTTY</a>. It starts when I log in and runs in the background with nothing but a system tray icon. It does all sorts of other X'y stuff, but all I want from my X server, is for it to stay out the way until needed. Hummingbird didn't, <a href="http://www.straightrunning.com/XmingNotes/">Xming </a>does. Lovely stuff.
