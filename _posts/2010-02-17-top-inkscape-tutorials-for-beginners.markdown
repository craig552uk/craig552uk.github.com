Recently I've been getting to grips with <a href="http://www.inkscape.org/">Inkscape</a>, the vector graphics editor, and mighty good it is too. To ease my climb up the learning curve I've been following a few tutorials. If, like me, you want to get a handle on Inkscape, try these bad boys out for size.
<h3>Working with Colour and Gradients</h3>
If you've never touched Inkscape before, this tutorial is a total must.

<h3>Spiro Swirls</h3>
A new feature in the latest version, this video tutorial (no sound) shows you haw to create killer spirals. Push the algorithm to the edge to see what it comes up with.

<h3>Text Styling</h3>
This tutorial runs through the great range of control that Inkscape gives you with text, and shows you how to make a great page title.

<h3>Creating Icons</h3>
This tutorial takes you through the process of creating a Tango style icon. Even if you're not interested in creating icons, there's a lot of good tips about working with paths in here.
