I have just this minute heard about a company, <a href="http://xtify.com/">Xtify</a>, which produces a communication framework for sending messages to mobile users based upon their location. This could be seriously amazing!
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-523" title="xtify" src="http://www.craig-russell.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/xtify.png" alt="" width="499" height="242" /></p>
You know when you hear something and it sends ideas pinging off in different directions like a particle collision? Reading about this gave me one of those moments.

Think about any scenario where you'd want real-time location specific information pushed to you. There's the obvious stuff, like retailers notifying customers of up-to-the minute promotions and offers. Imagine getting a message from the Deli round the corner, telling you that there's only two peri-peri chicken baguettes left?

This could really take off for events organisers. Wouldn't it be great  getting info about bands in the signing tent right now? But more  importantly not getting the info if you're on the other side of the  site?

But what about calling for help when you need it? In disaster situations, spreading information is essential. You can be told, not where all the heath centres are, but the nearest one to you, right now. This could make managing resources much easier. Messages directing people to the better equipped centres can be sent out over a larger area than the less equipped ones.

These are a few thoughts from a few minutes thinking. My brain's going to be chewing on this for a while...
