Just found this funky little beaut, <a href="http://wordle.net/">Wordle.net</a>. And to Quote form the site...

> Wordle is a toy for generating "word clouds" from text that you provide.

Here's one I've just knocked up from some documentation I've been writing.

<a href="http://www.craig-russell.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/pwm.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-10" title="pwm" src="http://www.craig-russell.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/pwm-300x129.jpg" alt="Wordleised" width="300" height="129" /></a>

Documentation = boring :(

Wordlised Documentation = Rock the Kasbah!
