In the good old British tradition of taking the piss. I've release a new  paper toy to commemorate the visit of the Pope to the UK. The Paper Pope, comes with a selection of choice papal paraphrased nonsense to attach to him. You can also download a sheet of blank speech bubbles to fill in yourself.

I'd love for you to take photographs of your pope and share them on twitter with the hash tag <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23paperpope">#paperpope</a>.

Have fun!
