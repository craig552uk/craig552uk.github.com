Mos blogs and forums offer a multitude of options for identifying myself when posting online, I can use my profile from Google, Twitter, Wordpress, Facebook and more. Helping to link various interjections together under the online umbrella that is me.

Sometimes, however, I choose to post anonymously. There's various reasons for this, I'm not the flame warring type, but there are occasions where I want to make a brief point and move on, I'm not always interested in a follow-up conversation.

But in selectively identifying myself, how am I skewing my online identy? If someoneÂ  (presumably mentally degraded) were to hunt down and read all my public data, would they get a fair representation of me? Would I want them to?

So here's my question to you...
