So, I got a Kindle for Xmas. It is awesome.

Pretty much the first thing I did with it is start hunting for free web development ebooks. I was quite surprised to find that there wasn't a free tag reference for HTML5.

So I made one.

It's not in the Amazon store, but you can download and copy it to you Kindle over USB.
