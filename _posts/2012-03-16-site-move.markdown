title: Site Move from Wordpress to GitHub
---

I've nothing against [Wordpress][7], I've used it for years and over that time it's developed from a fairly simple blogging platform to the comprehensive CMS it is today. For me, however, it has too much going on. So I'm leaving.

I've been scoping around for a new blogging platform. One that appeals to myself as a coder, that is simple to work with, light weight and as cheap as possible to run. For a while I toyed with buiilding my own platform using [Sinatra][1] hosted on [Heroku][2]. While this would allow me to write my posts in [markdown][3], version my site in Git and most importantly cost nothing. It didn't seem right to have Sinatra sat there as little more than a markdown interpreter.

I began looking back at [GitHub pages][4], which I've used before in various projects. Since the last time I'd used them they've added support for [Jekyll][5], which generates a static html blog from markdown files. Just what I needed.

So now I can author posts in markdown, version the site in Git and host the whole thing on GitHub. For free.

For now my site sits at [craig552uk.github.com][6] while I wrestle to get my domain back from my previous host. I'm also yet to migrate the images and downloads from the old site, so there'll be a lot of dead links around for a short while.

And of couse the site source is [here][8]
