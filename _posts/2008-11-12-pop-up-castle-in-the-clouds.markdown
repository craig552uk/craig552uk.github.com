I wrote about <a href="http://www.papierarchitectuur.nl/"><strong>Ingrid Siliakus</strong></a> a couple of weeks a go, and mentioned that <a href="http://www.evermore.com/catalog/product_info.php?products_id=55">her pop-ups</a> had inspired me to try something similar.

This is my interpretation of a castle in the clouds. The architecture of the castle was directly inspired by one of Ingrids pop-ups. This was fun to make, and I may try something similar in the future.
