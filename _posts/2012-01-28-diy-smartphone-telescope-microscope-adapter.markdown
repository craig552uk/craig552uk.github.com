I read on Mashable recently about the <a href="http://mashable.com/2012/01/05/skylight/" target="_blank">SkyLight</a>, a Smartphone adapter for a Microscope. I don't own a microscope, but I do have a telescope and I couldn't resist making one myself. Here's how I did it.

I've put full photo's of the build up on Flickr, if you want to check those out too.

<h2>Build Instructions</h2>

You will need the following
<ul>
	<li>A sheet of robust cardboard. Like the type you get on the back of a sketchpad.</li>
	<li>A cover cap from the eye piece of your telescope/microscope. This should fit the eyepiece snugly.</li>
	<li>One or two elastic bands big enough to wrap around your smartphone.</li>
	<li>Strong glue or epoxy resin.</li>
	<li>A craft knife.</li>
</ul>

Start by cutting a hole in the top of the eye piece cover with the craft knife. Leave enough of the top surface to apply glue later.

Next cut out a rectangle of cardboard large enough to support your smartphone. Make it big enough to adjust the position of the smartphone on the board so you can line up the camera with the eyepiece. Cut a hole lined up with the position of the phone camera, make the hole the same size as the hole in the eye piece cover. I also cut a few recesses in the edge to keep the elastic band in position. Using strong glue stick the eyepiece to the cardboard.

Once the glue has dried, use the elastic bands to attach our phone to the board. Fit the adapter to the eyepiece of your telescope/microscope. The board should be large enough to adjust the phone's camera to see clearly down the eyepiece.
