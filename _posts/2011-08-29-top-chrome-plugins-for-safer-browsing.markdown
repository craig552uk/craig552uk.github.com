You've gotta take your security seriously when using the web. Your actions on-line are being tracked and monitored constantly by various companies. This might not bother you, but it bothers me. Here's a few plugins for Google Chrome that give me a little more piece of mind when I'm online.

<h2><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gighmmpiobklfepjocnamgkkbiglidom">AdBlock</a></h2>

Blocks all (well most) ads on sites around the web. No-one likes ads, apart from the people pushing them, this plugin makes them go away.

<h2><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gofhjkjmkpinhpoiabjplobcaignabnl">Flash Block</a></h2>

Blocks all those irritating flash animations from jumping straight down your eyeballs when all you want to do is read an article. It lets you choose which flash objects to enable with a click. You can also white-list sites, preventing flash from being blocked at all (YouTube is white-listed by default).

<h2><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hhnjdplhmcnkiecampfdgfjilccfpfoe">Keep My Opt-Outs</a></h2>

A plugin provided by Google to stop Google from using your browser habits to send targeted ads. Needless to say, they don't market this very widely, but it is there.

<h2><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/mlomiejdfkolichcflejclcbmpeaniij">Ghostery</a></h2>

Ghostery aims to block those nasty tracking scripts from running in your browser. It doesn't promise to block everything, and requires a little configuration, but something is better than nothing.

<h2><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/flcpelgcagfhfoegekianiofphddckof">KB SSL Enforcer</a></h2>

This plugin checks every site you visit for SSL support, if it does it forces you to use it. SSL ensures that the information sent over the internet can only be read by the site you're visiting and no-one else along the way.

<h2><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lcncmkcnkcdbbanbjakcencbaoegdjlp">Google SSL Web Search</a></h2>

Adds a secure version of Google search to your search engines list. You should set Google SSL as your default search engine.

There's certainly more that you could do to <a href="https://encrypted.google.com/search?sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&q=safer+browsing+habits">improve your safety while on-line</a>, but adding these plug-ins to your browser is a good start.
