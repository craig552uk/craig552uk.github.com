There's a great <a href="http://www.designweek.co.uk/Articles/141224/Digital+3D+illustration+is+hard+to+resist+.html">article on 3D Illustration over at Design Week</a>.

<blockquote>There's something about three-dimensional illustration that can strike a powerful chord. Whether it's the Brothers Quay stock-motion, Tim Burton animation or work in editorial pages and on billboards, the world of tiny sets and realistic puppetry - with its hint of the oddball and grotesque - exudes a special pull, often harking back to childhood days.</blockquote>
