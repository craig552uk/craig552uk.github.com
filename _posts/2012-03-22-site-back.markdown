title: I've Got My Domain Back
---

Finally, I've managed to get my domain transferred from my previous host. The package I was on required me to pay Â£5.99 to transfer *MY* domain away form them. I completely object to them holding my domain to ransom like this. But after a series of emails, in which they refused to waive the charge, I was left with little option but to relent and reluctantly paid up.

But at least I have my domain back.

I now happily hosted with [Heart Internet][1]. I've used Heart in the past and find them a [very pleasant][2] company to deal with.

And they offer [Rack hosting][3] now too!
