What's the point in Recorded Delivery? I pay five times more than a stamp fo what? To make sure my post gets there? Can't the Royal Mail just not loose my letters? Obviously not, otherwise they wouldn't offer the service.

Actually, Royal Mail, here's a suggestion for you, why not print to odd's of a letter reaching it's destination on to the stamp?
<ul>
	<li>1st class - 10:1</li>
	<li>2nd class - 20:1</li>
	<li>1st class large envelope (don't get me started) - Guaranteed to be bent.</li>
	<li>Anything that rattles - 2:1 it'll be more rattly when it gets there.</li>
	<li>Anything that looks like a birthday card - 0 chance if it's got a bit of cash in it.</li>
</ul>
Stupid post.
