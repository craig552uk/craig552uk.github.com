I'm not much for "new year resolutions" but I have decided that this year I'm going to pull my finger out and be a bit more pro-active about doing things that I've been putting off. 2011 saw me finishing my MSc and being awarded a Distinctions for my efforts. Throughout the course I discovered that I actually quite enjoy writing, so this year I'm setting out to do more of that (most likely on this blog). I've also had a few opportunities to do a bit of presentational speaking (both with the course and with work) which I found an uncomfortable experience, but this is something I'd like to get better at too.

2012 will also see me starting a new job at the <a href="http://www.le.ac.uk">University of Leicester</a>, which I am really excited about. I'll be working as a Web Developer in the Marketing and Communications team and can't wait to get stuck in. Developing for the web has been a big part of my working and personal life for the past decade or so, but this is the first job I've had where it will be the main focus of the role. Given the phenomenal rate of change in the industry I can't wait to devote my full working day to learning about and applying some of the fascinating technologies that are being developed.

I've also <del datetime="2011-12-31T16:28:29+00:00">been tricked</del> agreed to run a <a href="http://quest-events.co.uk/frolics.htm">10k "fun run"</a> in March with some of my former colleagues. We'll be raising money for Rainbows Hospice for Children and Young People so <a href="http://www.justgiving.com/Farmyardfrolics2012">give generously</a>. Because of this 2012 (or the first three months at least) will involve me doing a bit of training. I haven't done anything approaching exercise since May, so I've got a fair bit of ground to make up there.

Lastly, but most significantly, I'm going to become an uncle in the summer to my brothers child. I can't say how excited my wife and I are and we can't wait to meet the little Russell.

So that's what I'm looking forward to in 2012. It's gonna be fun.
